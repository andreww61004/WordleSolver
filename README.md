When entering a clue for the program to eliminate words, please use the following format:

When entering a correct letter in the correct place, enter a # before you enter the character.
When entering a correct letter in the incorrect place, enter a $ before you enter the character.
When entering an incorrect letter, do not enter anything before the character: simply type the character and continue.

ENTER ALL LOWERCASE CHARACTERS AS THE PROGRAM DOES NOT MAKE THEM LOWERCASE FOR YOU.
